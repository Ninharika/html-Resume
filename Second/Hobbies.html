<p>Hobbies are something people do it in their pass time. I do have few. I love reading books mostly of self help one's. Watching animal documentaries keeps me clouds.
    web development learning made me to count it as a hobby. Gyming my Favourite habit rather than a hobby.
    Few of them might be common in others too, but these are the things makes me feel me.
